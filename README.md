BigLan Network Monitoring System
================================
BigLan is a network monitoring system designed primarily for medium to large
internal networks. It aims to help system administrators and network engineers manage
poorly or completely undocumented networks. The system is used to map
and monitor the network and keep the device inventory up to date.
BigLan is built from two main parts: a server (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04, Apache, MySQL, Laravel) and
client-side service applications. The client applications send data to the server, which
creates a record and allows inferences to be made about the state of the endpoint
devices and the network from the events.
